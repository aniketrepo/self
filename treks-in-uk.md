## The Cuillin Ridge Traverse
* The Cuillin Ridge Traverse is a magnificent climb following a continous 12-km ridge crest from one end to the other.
* Situated on the Isle of Skye, rivals the greatest ridges in the Alps for beauty and quality.
* It is an alpine-style route unlike anything else in the UK but one should be a highly competent mountaineer to complete it.
* It is a 7-mile long ridge traverse having 13,000-ft of ascent, 11 Munros, and the same basic rock-climbing.
