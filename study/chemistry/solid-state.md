# Chapter 1, Solid State

## General Characteristics of solid state
* They have definite mass, volume and shape.
* Inter molecular distances are short.
* Inter-molecular forces are strong.
* Their constituent particles (like atoms, ions and molecules) have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions.
* They are incompressible and rigid.

## Amorphous and Crystalline Solids

|Crystalline Solids                              |Amorphous Solids                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Long range, orderly arrangement of constituents.|Short range, random arrangement of constituents.                   |
|Definite Shape                                  |Irregular Shape                                                    |
|They are generally anisotropic in nature.       |They are isotropic like liquids.                                   |                            
|They are true solids.                           |They are considered as pseudo solids or super cooled solids.       |
|Definite heat of fusion.                        |Heat of fusion is not definite.                                    |
|They have sharp melting points.                 |Gradually soften over a range of temperature and so can be moulded.|
|For example, NaCl and Diamonds etc.             |For example, Rubber and Plastics etc.                              |
